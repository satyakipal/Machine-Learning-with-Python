### Introduction
We are living in a beautiful world and in this world we have `Humans` and `Computers`.
And one of the main difference between Humans and Computers is that Humans learn from `Experiences` and Computers need to be told what to do.
That is Humans take any decisions based on Experiences while Computers `Follow Instructions`.
Now the question is can we make computers learn based on  Experiences? and the answer is `Yes`.
And this is preciously what `Machine Learning` is designed to do.

Ofcourse for computers, past experience have a name, we call it as `Data`.
So for rest of this article  I am gonna show some examples to make you understand how computers learn from data it has processed earlier.
