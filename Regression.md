## Regression Models
Regression Models (both linear and non-linear) are used to predict real values, like salaries,rent e.t.c
If yourindependent variable is time(on X-axis), then you can forcast present as well as future values which are unknown.
There is a wide ranfe of Regression Techniques that we follow while predicting and developping our Models based on requirements.

In this Repository we will cover the following Models of Regression:
* [Simple Linear Regression]()
* [Multiple Linear Regression]()
* [Polynomial Regression]()
* [Support Vector for Regression]()
* [Decision Tree Classification]()
* [Random Forest Classification]()
