### Simple Linear Regression- intuition
Linear regression is a statistical approach for modelling relationship between a dependent
variable with a given set of independent variables.
Generally we refer `dependent variables as Response` and `independent variables as Features`.

Simple linear regression is an approach for predicting a response using a single feature.

It is assumed that the two variables are linearly related. Hence, we try to find a linear function that predicts the response value(y) 
as accurately as possible as a function of the feature or independent variable(x).
